	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is used to analyze how efficient an algorithm is by measuring the amount of time it takes to run as the input size increases. Understanding Time complexity helps developers write efficient code.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. Space Complexity is often expressed using notations like O(n), which shows how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
